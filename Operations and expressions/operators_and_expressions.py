#  Logical lines can contain expressions
#  Expressions can be broken down in to operators and operands.
#  For example

mathStatement = 2 + 3
print(mathStatement)

#  These two statement prints the product of the sum 2 + 3
#  mathStatement is assigned the value 5, as 2 + 3 is 5
#  The second statement contains a print function that prints the value, 5

#  + is the operator. It is an addition operation. Operations either combine or manipulate values.
#  2 and 3 are operands. They are the values
